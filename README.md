# Project Description
In this project I was tasked with looking into the public Buffalo 311 Request data, along with any comparitive data,
to analyze for general trends or comparisons with the data sets.
I decided to look at both the open 311 Request data and the Crime Incident data, focused on the entire 2022 year.

In this analysis I focused on the following:
* General cleanup and manipulation of the data sets
  * To be able answer questions with the most compelling visuals
* Looking at the most common occurences in each data set
  * Request Reasons for the 311 data, Incident Type for the Crime data
* Types of crimes and their trends over specific days of the week
* Geo-Map visuals shocasing the breakout of requests/crimes by the Buffalo Neighborhoods
